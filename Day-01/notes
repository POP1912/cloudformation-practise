Today, I have installed aws-cli
Configured them using "aws configure" and retrieved my access key and secret keys from IAM user Security Credentials section 
(These keys must be kept secret, when uploading the data in internet, please remove any keys from the code/section and upload)
As I'm already having Visual Studio, I'm not gonna install that again.
Now, it's time to install "aws cloudformation linter". A linter will proactively detects basic errors in cloudformation - "pip install cfn-lint"
Already installed GIT.
Ok, now I may need to clone the tutorial repo, from "git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/cfn101-workshop"
Now to move forward to the Basics part of cf, we need to cross-check the default VPC in our region
All set-up is done.
