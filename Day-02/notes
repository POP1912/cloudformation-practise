Today, I'm gonna do the ""Basic"" part of the cf.
We will build an initial template.
We will follow YAML format in cf
First I will create a simple S3 bucket
Didn't understood exactly the templatestructure, as where to use "-" and where to give indentations.
But created the S3 bucket with the template, enabled Versioning and enabled ServerSide Encryption.
